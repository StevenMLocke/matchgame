# I laughed at the thought...

## That will teach me

I was watching a video and a developer proposed this project as a challenge for beginning developers.  I thought that it was just to be something silly and lightweight. The logic isn't too difficult to think about. However, decent implementation is a little bit different of a story.

I have been learning a lot from doing this project. Not so much about the code but rather, about overestimating what I think I that I know.

In studying luthiery I have read that the art itself is less about the building and building process and more about making mistakes and learning/knowing how to correct them successfully.  I am finding the same to be true in my code work.
